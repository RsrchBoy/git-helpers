NAME
    Git::Helpers - Shortcuts for common Git commands

VERSION
    version 0.000004

SYNOPSIS
        use Git::Helpers qw( checkout_root );
        my $root = checkout_root();

  checkout_root( $dir )
    Gives you the root level of the git checkout which you are currently in.
    Optionally accepts a directory parameter. If you provide the directory
    parameter, "checkout_root" will temporarily "chdir" to this directory
    and find the top level of the repository.

    This method will throw an exception if it cannot find a git repository
    at the directory provided.
